The notice warns that several incidents have occurred recently in different places in Australia where overseas Chinese students have been insulted and attacked.

One incident took place at a bus interchange in Canberra, Australia's capital, on October 23, 2017.

According to a report from Xinhua, two Chinese students studying in local high schools were attacked by a group of local teenagers after declining to give them cigarettes.

The Chinese students suffered from cuts and bruises2, with one of them being hospitalized for two days.

The Canberra Times is also reporting that a number of Chinese students claim to have been "frequently harassed3" in the same area, suggesting they "regularly felt threatened and targeted" in south Canberra.

A member of the local Chinese community is suggesting the community in Canberra is becoming "very worried for these kids."

Local authorities have reportedly stepped up patrols in the area since the incident.
